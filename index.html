	<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I’m an ABC <b>(Australian Born Chinese)</b>, and I was raised the same way as any other Aussie kid in southwestern Sydney. While my parents speak Chinese to me and I can understand it, I respond to them in English. I graduated from Menai High School in 2018, and took a gap year to decide what I wanted to study, eventually settling on Information Technology at RMIT. I have a lot of nerdy hobbies, and I often spend my free time gaming; once a month, I get together with some of my high school friends to play Dungeons & Dragons.</p>

	<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
		<h2><i>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest start?</i></h2>
			<p>My interest in IT has existed for as long as I can remember. I was really interested in educational video games when I was in preschool, and I remember always being interested in whatever my mum was doing while she worked from home, mainly because I liked the sound of her keyboard.
				<br>
				<br>
			As I’ve grown older, my interest in IT has evolved greatly, with new knowledge from hobbies and also school. I’m interested in the process of IT as a whole from planning to implementation to its social impact. 
				<br>
				<br>
			I’ve been surrounded by IT for my whole life, and while I don’t have much professional experience in the field, I’ve always enjoyed helping others with their tech problems. I was part of a club in high school called the ‘tech wizards’, where we’d help other students with any tech issues they may have had.
				<br>
				<br>
			For about six months, I partook in a digital marketing internship, where I eventually freelanced for about six months. On the side, I also did some Oceanic Esports journalism, where I gained experience with writing articles and copy.

			</figure>
			</p>
		<h2><i>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</i></h2>
			<p>I had a few friends at the physical Melbourne campus studying IT, and heard good things about the technology programs at the school. The school is also one of the best in Australia with what they do, and the option of studying remotely is really appealing to me.</p>
			<br>
		<h2><i>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</i></h2>
			<p>During my degree, I’m expecting to learn about a lot of concepts and issues that are completely foreign to me, and honestly a bit intimidating. With the assistance of my peers and tutors, I’ll be able to conquer these fears and gain a greater understanding of the field, along with gaining a broader understanding of some of my personal interests. I’m expecting to learn a lot about IT, but also about working in a team environment, and bringing concepts to life.</p>

			Ideal Job - Digital Marketing Manager
		</a>
	</h1>
		<h2><i>Description of the position, and particularly, what makes this position appealing to you</i></h2>
			<p>A digital marketing manager controls all aspects of marketing a brand in the digital media sector. This includes creating strategies for marketing campaigns, looking at analytics to find a target audience, and then creating content that appeals to your target demographic, in order to gain a following. I’ve always enjoyed writing professionally, and enjoyed the challenge of copywriting. The social media marketing industry is constantly changing, whether it be from changes to the platforms themselves, or the ‘meta’ as a whole, and I find this extremely interesting to adapt in such a fast-paced environment. With a personal interest and passion for gaming, this position would be ideal for me.</p>
			<br>
		<h2><i>A description of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position</i></h2>
			<p>Experience with identifying target audiences and executing successful marketing campaigns is required, along with copywriting and previous brand handling. The only proper qualification is a strong recommendation to possess a business marketing qualification. Other notable experience would be that of familiarity with the gaming and esports scene, along with possessing experience in digital and social media platforms and software.</p>
			<br>
		<h2><i>A description of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have</i></h2>
			<p>I currently possess some experience in analytics along with content creation for digital and social media platforms, with a sound understanding of catering to a target audience through copywriting. I also possess some skill with software in the Adobe Creative Suite such as Premiere and Photoshop.</p>
			<br>
		<h2><i>A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now.</i></h2>
			<p>Through the Information Technology course at RMIT, I’ll gain a wider understanding of IT as a whole, and develop a variety of skills in software such as Photoshop, Premiere along with coding, while also obtaining a qualification upon the course completion. I plan to read up on successful/viral social media campaigns, specifically in regards to interacting with gamers, and learn about what works and what doesn’t. Although I have previous experience with social media marketing, I’d seek new opportunities in the field, and gain on-the-job experience, potentially under the mentorship of other digital marketers. I would partake in professional writing along with content creation and analytics, implementing them into current digital media campaigns.</p>

		<h2><i>What do the results of these tests mean to you?</i></h2>
			<p>I believe that the results of these tests are accurate representations of my personality and characteristics. Something common among the three is that I’m an enabler of sorts, and will always make sure everyone contributes to a discussion before we come to a decision as a group. In groups of individuals, I often find myself to be in the center of conflict, should any arise, and I’ll do everything in my power to defuse high-tension situations. The results also indicate that one of my greatest strengths is encouraging and moderating discussions, where we can go over information in theory before putting anything into practice. At the same time, I’m open to the idea of experimenting with unfamiliar concepts, and learning from past mistakes.</p>
			<br>
		<h2><i>How do you think these test results may influence your behaviour in a team?</i></h2>
			<p>I think one of my greatest strengths and also weaknesses will be communication with my team members, and making sure everyone’s on board and up to date, with a sound understanding of whatever we are doing. Gryffindors make their best attempt to befriend their peers, and I’d strongly encourage ‘team bonding’ activities, to help us grow beyond the professional relationship of a team, however, others in the team may want to work without any of the informalities. On the more negative side of things, due to my Introverted nature, I believe that I will seek constant feedback and validation from my peers, to ensure that my work is being completed to a satisfactory standard. While I’ll listen to others and encourage them to participate in discussions, I also require the same encouragement due to my uncertainty; this trait may clash with anyone that has an Extroverted personality type, as I’m often afraid to speak up if someone else is leading a forum.</p>
			<br>
		<h2><i>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</i></h2>
			<p>When forming a team, I need to be surrounded by a group that will take time to build each other up, and work together, instead of having one person do all the work. I would form a team where everyone is on the same page from the beginning, and is passionate about the work, willing to put in as much effort as anyone else. At the same time, I would find a group that wants to grow as a team, that works well by learning from each other and participating in group discussions. Preferably, the group would have a mix of various personality types in order for us to learn the most from each other. While I am an introvert that encourages discussion and conversation, having an extrovert that possesses the same quality would be extremely beneficial, as we’ll be able to work off each other. While personality clashes are often inevitable, I would like to form a team that is lighthearted and also patient with one another, despite other personality traits that may clash. As long as those traits are maintained throughout the group, I believe that it will be a beneficial and rewarding experience.</p>

	<h1>Project Idea</h1>
		<h2><i>Overview</i></h2>
			<p><b><i>Discord</i></b> is a popular VoIP and instant messaging software in the video gaming community, and currently has over 250 million users. The application is available on both PC and mobile, and also supports the use of ‘bots’, which are automated accounts with coded functionality, such as moderating chatrooms to delete messages that contain any preset words. <b><i>Final Fantasy XIV (FFXIV)</i></b> is a Massive Multiplayer Online (MMO) game, and there is a job in the game that allows you to gather materials at set times within the game’s clock <b>(Eorzea Time/E.T.)</b>; these are referred to as Timed Nodes. I would like to create a Discord bot that will notify the user when Timed Nodes will spawn.</p>
			<br>
		<h2><i>Motivation</i></h2>
			<p>As an avid gamer, I use Discord as a one-stop platform for almost everything. I use it to communicate with friends both over voice chat and text, and also for sending images and information. There is already a website that will inform you of these Timed Nodes spawning, but I find it quite difficult to navigate, and easily forgotten about due to its inconvenience. Having a bot programmed with the same information on Discord, will prove to be a lot more convenient. I’ll also gain a better understanding of the programming behind a bot, and be able to transfer these skills to other future projects, such as creating a bot that can moderate a community Discord chatroom.</p>
			<br>
		<h2><i>Description</i></h2>
			<p>This project will be a Discord bot that will be added to a personal server, and will respond to certain commands with set responses, written in Javascript. This will begin with a bot that says ‘hello!’, then escalate.</p>
				
			<p>Discord is an “all-in-one- voice and text chat for gamers” that is widely used in communities worldwide. Upon creating a Discord account, you’ll receive a unique ID and also be able to create your own ‘server’. Through this server, you can invite other users to join with a URL, where they gain access to text and voice channels. With this unique ID, users can be ‘mentioned’ in the text channels, and it will send a notification to them specifically. Discord bots take on the form of users, and are able to send and moderate messages in text channels, depending on their function.</p>
				
			<p>In FFXIV, Timed Nodes will spawn in set locations within the game’s world whenever the in-game clock ticks to a certain hour. These nodes are only available for set periods of time, often between 5 to 10 minutes in <b>Real Time (R.T.)</b>, before they disappear for a set interval, usually around 12 to 24 hours (E.T.) or 35 to 70 minutes (R.T.). The bot will be programmed with information about the Timed Nodes. This will include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><i>A countdown (R.T.) until its next spawn</i></li>
					<li><i>Image of the in-game item</i></li>
					<li><i>X, Y, Z co-ordinate of its in-game location</i></li>
					<li><i>Name of the in-game zone</i></li>
					<li><i>Set spawn times (E.T)</i></li>
				</ul>
			<p>When prompted with certain commands, the bot will respond to the user in the text channel, with the information listed above.</p>
			
			<p>The bot will only respond to commands that are given a set prefix; this will be a symbol followed by a short phrase such as <b>!node</b> or <b>?node</b>. The bot will not respond unless a set phrase is used. An example of a correct command, with ! as the example would be <i>'!node Tender Dill'</i>, whereas <i>‘!time Tender Dill’</i> would not have any results. While the prefix is correct, the phrase is not programmed into the bot, therefore there wouldn’t be a response.
			
			<p>When this command is used, all information on the in-game item of Tender Dill will be sent by the bot in response. This will include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><i>A countdown (R.T.) until its next spawn</i></li>
					<li><i>Image of the in-game item</i></li>
					<li><i>X, Y, Z co-ordinate of its in-game location</i></li>
					<li><i>Name of the in-game zone</i></li>
					<li><i>Set spawn times</i></li>
				</ul>
				
			<p>One of the key functions of the bot, would be a ‘!notify’ command, that will mention a user that uses it, five minutes before a specified node spawns into the world. For example, a user typing ‘!notify Tender Dill’ into a designated chatroom will register/unregister users to a list. Whenever the node spawns, the bot will send a message into a text channel in the server, mentioning any of the users that have signed up for a notification about Tender Dill spawning. Within the message, the following details will also be listed:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><i>Image of the in-game item</i></li>
					<li><i>X, Y, Z co-ordinate of its in-game location</i></li>
					<li><i>Name of the in-game zone</i></li>
				</ul>

		<h2><i>Tools and Technologies</i></h2>
			<ul>
				<li>A computer or phone with Discord installed is a necessity for this project, in order to create the server for the bot and user to join. It is also necessary to view the resulting outputs.</li>
				<li>A monitor for information to be displayed.</li>
				<li>A router for internet access. This is neccessary for Discord itself, along with access for Discord's API library along along with Node.js, which is required for the JavaScript.</li>
				<li>A keyboard and a mouse for user inputs.</li>
				<li>A private server for the bot to be hosted on.</li>
			</ul>
		<h2><i>Skills required</i></h2>
			<p>A program will need to be written for the project in Javascript. As I do not have any prior experience, I will seek online resources and help from others well versed in the language, learning how to create a bot that will respond to my inputs. Over time, I will learn how to implement more complicated features, and eventually achieve my project idea. There are many online resources that are available in both creating Discord Bots and lessons on Javascript that I will have at my disposal.</p>
		<h2><i>Outcome</i></h2>
			<p>If the project is successful, the Discord bot will function as required, and will deliver whatever relevant information is requested to the user about timed nodes, this will mitigate the issue of inconvenience associated with other resources that accomplish the same task. This project will not only impact myself, but it can be shared with other FFXIV players that face the same issues, being a convenient way to check information about nodes without having to open a web browser.</p>
